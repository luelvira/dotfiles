* ~$HOME/.dotfiles~

Since I read about the literature config with emacs, I felt in love with them, so I start using it for all kinds of configuration

** Management

I only create symlinks for files, never for folder. This helps me to keep the repository clean when some programs use its folder as a store space. At this moment, I still use stown.

** Software I use

This apply for my PC (debian based)
- *EDITOR*: As editor I use [[https://www.vim.org/][vim]], but I'm moving to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] (really, why I have to make this to me??)
- *WM* A tilling window manager is a window manager with an organization into non-overlapping frames. but they don't only allow you to maximize the screen space, also allow you a full keyboard navigation. In my case, I use [[https://i3wm.org/][I3WM]], but I thinking to move to [[https://qtile.org/][qtile]]
- *Compositor and notification daemon* A window manager does not come with a lot of software like the compositor or the notification daemons. To get it working, I will [[https://github.com/yshui/picom][picom]] and [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][dunst]] respectively.
- *launcher*: [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] as a replacement for dmenu
- *Terminal* Alacritty. I have a little problems with this terminal because in debian system is very old.


** Structure

The structure of the project try to be very simple. Each software has its own folder. If the folder is very simple, it could be inside the ~config~ folder, and then, make a symbolic link to the ~$HOME/.config~ folder. In other case, if I need more access to it, it will be at the root. Something similar happens with the /bash/ files, whose have their own folder.

*** ~config~ folder
The equivalent to ~$HOME/.config~, where all the configuration files will be stored for most of the programs

 - ~alacritty~: The configuration for the terminal
 - ~autostart~: Sometimes, you have programs that should be run when you login on the system, but not as scripts file, instead as desktop file
 - ~i3~: The configuration for the window manager
 - ~systemd/user~ For custom services that DOES NOT be run as sudo
 - ~dunst~: We all need sometimes a kind of notification
 - ~picom~
 - ~polybar~: A bar menu for system information. This folder also contains some scripts to improve it uses
 - ~rofi~: The launcher. Also has some scripts required to full working

*** ~bash~ folder
Where the root files will be places. This include all the bashrc, bash_alias, profile... This helps to keep it order

*** ~vim~ folder

Sometimes, vim need some extra plugins or folder, but the main config file will be at [[file:bash/.vimrc][.vimrc]]

** Important files

1. [[file:Emacs.org][Emacs.org]] The literature configuration file for emacs. This will tangle into different files as needed
2. [[file:vim.org][vim.org]] The same, but for vim/nvim

** Install

There are some package that I need to install manually to get all working fine when I install the system without graphical environment

#+begin_src shell
sudo apt-get install \
  lightdm lightdm-gretter i3 polybar dunst rofi feh \
  make cmake build-essential git python3-virtualenv \
  wget curl \
  vim-nox xclip alacritty emacs stow
#+end_src

I provide a simple script which iter over the different folders and create the symlinks in their respective folders. *Note* This script won't install anything, so you must install it to make it works.

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:luelvira/dotfiles.git --depth 1
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
stow bash -vt ~
stow --no-folding config -vt ~/.config
stow --no-folding local -vt ~/.local
stow --no-folding vim -vt ~/.vim
#+end_src

Also I use a lot of virtualenv for python and nodejs. Read [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][pyenv]] and [[https://github.com/ekalinin/nodeenv][nodeenv]] for more info

#+begin_src shell
git submodules init
git submodules update
#+end_src
